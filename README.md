This repository is where I place my code to create my shinyapps. Here is a brief description of the apps here now.

BasketSimulator (https://aswoboda.shinyapps.io/BasketSimulator) is an app I created for an introductory econometrics course at Carleton College. The app simulates a binomial distribution using the example of a basketball player shooting baskets multiple times. The idea is to help students understand how uncertainty and variance are manifested in a random variable. For instance, the default settings in the app show that a shooter who typically makes 50 percent of shots, can make 15 out of 20 shots, but it isn't very likely. The app allows the user to change the shooting success proportion, the number of shots taken as well as the number of times the simulation is run.
