## Goal

Explore the effects of entry/exit on competitive market equilibrium when there are identical profit maximizing firms.

## Assumptions

* All firms are identical and are at the long run average cost minimizing production technology/scale.
* Firms are profit maximizing.
* Long Run equilibrium economic profits are zero.

## Firm Costs

There are two important types of costs for a firm in the long run - marginal costs and average costs. Marginal costs will help the firm find the profit maximizing level of output to produce. Average costs will help the firm make a decision regarding market entry and exit.

### Marginal Costs

For simiplicity, let's give the firms a linear marginal cost curve with a given intercept and slope.
